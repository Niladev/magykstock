# magykstock

Small project that syncs the stock from [Loyverse POS](https://loyverse.com/) to [Squarespace ecommerce site](https://www.squarespace.com/). 

Messy, but reliable and created for the family shop to keep their stock in sync between their online shop and in shop POS. 

Something that was not possible before.
